üöÄ SmartLaunch Framework: ML-Driven Optimization for Product Launch Timing & Customer Targeting
Intelligent Decision-Making for Seasonally Sensitive Markets
üí° Executive Summary
The SmartLaunch Framework solves the critical business problem of fragmented product launch planning by integrating two distinct data science pipelines: Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) for sales forecasting (the 'When') and PCA-enhanced K-Means Clustering for customer segmentation (the 'Who').

This integrated ML approach provides a data-backed, dual-axis operational strategy, allowing a consumer health company to launch its successor product at the peak of demand and target the most receptive customer segment, thereby maximizing revenue and minimizing market risk.

üéØ The Optimal Strategic Prescription
Based on the integrated analysis, the recommended launch strategy is:

Launch Timing (The 'When')	Target Segment (The 'Who')	Key Outcome
Q1 2026 (Peak Demand)	Cluster 1 (High Spend/Frequency)	Maximize ROI and adoption rate with an estimated ‚Ç¨884,822 in Q1 sales.

Cluster 1 Profile (Upgrade-Ready Segment)
Lifetime Spend: Highest (Avg. ‚Ç¨424.53)
Purchase Frequency: High (Avg. 6.5)
Satisfaction Score: High (Avg. 4.6)
Strategic Action: Direct initial marketing and pre-launch campaigns exclusively to this high-value, high-intent segment.

‚öôÔ∏è Core Methodology
The framework is split into two parallel data science pipelines, unified to form a single output.

1. Launch Timing Pipeline: Forecasting Demand (SARIMA)
Step	Technique	Rationale & Output
Preprocessing	ADF Test & Differencing	Ensured time series stationarity to meet model assumptions.
Model Selection	Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA)	Chosen for its superior ability to capture monthly seasonality and long-term trends in sales data, achieving a significantly lower MAPE.
Result	Sales forecast extending to 2026, pinpointing Q1 as the next seasonal peak.	

2. Customer Targeting Pipeline: Reproducible Segmentation (K-Means/PCA)
Step	Technique	Rationale & Output
Dimensionality Reduction	Principal Component Analysis (PCA)	Reduced noise and multicollinearity across customer attributes (Income, Frequency, Spend) to ensure stable, interpretable cluster centers.
Clustering	K-Means Algorithm	Grouped customers based on behavioral and financial metrics.
Validation	Silhouette Analysis	Confirmed the optimal number of groups to be k=4 with a validation score of 0.436.
